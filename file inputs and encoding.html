    <p>although the input type is "file," the user will not be able to upload a file unless a special attribute, within the form element, entitled enctype is declared and assigned a value; namely "multipart/form-data"</p>

        <label>
    Choose file to upload
    <input type="file" name="my-file" id="">

    </form>
    <p>"multipart" means that when a file is submitted, it will be broken up and sent in multiple parts because of its great size</p>
