    <p>There is an element called "img." There is no closing tag, only an opening tag. There is no text content, just an image (png, gif, jpeg).</p>
    <p>IMG needs an attribute. something=something else. SRC (=source) = image.file.</p>
    <p>Although HTML allows images to be modified by size and width, CSS is more often used to do this task.</p>
    <p>Essential information should not be contianed in an image because a user's browser may not support it, or the image may not appear because the server or address may be down.</p>
    <p>Screen readers will read the alt attribute aloud if the image fails to load.</p>
    <p>Here is an external image <img src="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/cover.jpg" alt="textbook cover"></p>
    <p>Here is an internal image <img src="IMG_0633.jpeg" width="200" height="400" alt="photo of my son Yanitus and I"></p>
